Option 1: Use official mini-SWE-agent + Gemini 2.5 Pro for SWE-bench

This repository keeps τGuardian's own SWE harness small and provider-agnostic.
For Gemini 2.5 Pro / Gemini 3 Pro SWE-bench runs that match the public leaderboard,
you should:

1) Install mini-SWE-agent and follow its SWE-bench quickstart.
2) Configure Gemini via LiteLLM or the recommended provider config.
3) Run their official SWE-bench command (bash-only or full, as desired).
4) Save their predictions/results JSONL for later analysis.
5) Use τGuardian's analysis scripts to compute CRI/SAD/τ-style metrics
   on those runs, or to compare against τGuardian's internal harness.

No extra Python dependencies are added here; Option 1 is intentionally
implemented as an external pipeline so that the core harness + tests
(`pytest -q`) continue to run in a lightweight virtualenv.
